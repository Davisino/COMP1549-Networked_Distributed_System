COMP1549-Networked_Distributed_System Project using Java
This project aims to create a networked distributed system using Java. The system will consist of a server and multiple clients, which will be able to communicate with each other over the network. The server will be responsible for managing the clients and their connections, while the clients will be able to send messages to each other through the server.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Installing
To install the project, you can clone the repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COMP1549-Networked_Distributed_System.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

Running the Server
To run the server, navigate to the server directory and run the following command:

java Server
The server will start listening for client connections on the default port (1234). You can change the port by editing the Server.java file.

Running the Client
To run the client, navigate to the client directory and run the following command:
java Client
The client will prompt you for a username and then connect to the server. Once connected, you can send messages to other clients by typing them into the console.

Usage
To use the system, you will need to start the server and multiple clients. Each client will need to enter a unique username. Once connected, clients can send messages to each other by typing them into the console. The server will relay the messages between clients.
